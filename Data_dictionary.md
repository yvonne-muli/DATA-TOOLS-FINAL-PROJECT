# Data Dictionary

## Project Overview
This database was created for the *Data Tools Final Project*.  
It represents a simple school management system that tracks students, the courses they take, and their enrollments.  
The database includes three main tables: *Students, **Courses, and **Enrollment*, each with sample data to demonstrate relationships.

| course_id | INT (FK) | References the course enrolled in | 2 |

---

## Relationships
- Each *student* can be enrolled in *many courses*.  
- Each *course* can have *many students* enrolled.  
- student_id in Enrollment references Students.student_id  
- course_id in Enrollment references Courses.course_id

---

### Notes
- The database follows a *many-to-many* relationship between Students and Courses, implemented through the Enrollment table.  
- This structure makes it easy to track which students are taking which courses.
